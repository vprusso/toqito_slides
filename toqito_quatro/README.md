# Unitary Compiler Collection

**Venue**: FOSDEM (Brussels, BE)

**Date**: Feb 2, 2025

## Abstract

Compilers are vital tools for turning code into efficient executables that run on machines, making them a key part of
classical computing infrastructure.  While classical computing benefits from a wealth of sophisticated compiler tools,
the quantum computing landscape is young in its software tooling development.  In this talk I'll motivate the need for a
new, cross-platform quantum circuit compiler which goes beyond existing tools.

At Unitary Foundation, we are developing the Unitary Compiler Collection (UCC)—a Python library designed for
frontend-agnostic, high-performance compilation of quantum circuits.  Think of it as GCC, but for quantum computers.
We’ll share benchmarking results comparing UCC to current quantum circuit compilers across real-world applications and
explore future directions to push the boundaries of quantum compilation.
